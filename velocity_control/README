velocity_control: The template for the velocity control module

The goal of the velocity_control module is to control the robot according to a
given command (received over ROS).

Here is the definition of this module:
	Input: Linear speed (m/s) and Angular speed (rad or deg/s) and time (1 sec default) (should copy turtlesim)
	Parameters: configuration file containing maximums for both linear and angular speeds
	Output: Command to any car (using PWM, or on-off-control, ...)
	State machine: Initial (End of trajectory, at the boot), Run (running normally)
		Pause (waiting to resume), Emergency (errors, fatal errors, kill-switch)
	Tests:  1) Straight forward at 0.2m/s (during 1s)
		2) Straight backward at 0.2m/s (during 1s)
		3) turn wheels without driving
		4) Turn in circle to the left (during 1s, at 0.2m/s, 20deg/s)
		5) Turn in circle to the right (during 1s, at 0.2m/s, -20deg/s)
		6) Turn in circle to the left, driving backward (during 1s, at -0.2m/s, 20deg/s)
		7) Turn in circle to the right, driving backward (during 1s, at -0.2m/s, -20deg/s)
		1-7bis) All tests from 1 to 7 but for 5s
		1-7ter) All tests from 1 to 7 at full linear/angular speed for 3s
